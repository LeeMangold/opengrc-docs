# Asset Management

OpenGRC provides comprehensive IT asset management capabilities to track hardware, software licenses, and equipment throughout their lifecycle. Assets can be linked to control implementations, enabling compliance tracking at the asset level.

## Overview

Asset management in OpenGRC enables organizations to:

- Maintain a complete hardware and software inventory
- Track asset assignment and location
- Manage financial information (purchase, depreciation, value)
- Monitor warranty and support contracts
- Track lifecycle stages (acquisition to disposal)
- Link assets to security controls and implementations
- Maintain compliance and security status

## Linking Assets to Implementations

Assets can be linked to implementations (controls) to track which security measures apply to specific assets.

### From the Asset Detail Page
1. Open an asset
2. Go to the **Implementations** tab
3. Click **Attach** to add implementations
4. Search and select relevant implementations
5. Save

### From an Implementation
1. Open an implementation
2. Go to the **Assets** tab
3. Click **Attach** to add assets
4. Select assets this implementation covers
5. Save

## Parent-Child Asset Relationships

Assets can have hierarchical relationships for complex equipment:

- A server rack can be a parent to multiple servers
- A workstation bundle can include a desktop, monitor, and peripherals
- Track component assets under their parent asset

To set a parent asset:
1. Edit the child asset
2. Select the **Parent Asset** field
3. Choose the parent asset
4. Save

## Searching and Filtering

### Search
Search assets by:
- Asset tag
- Name
- Serial number
- Manufacturer
- Model

### Filters
Filter the asset list by:
- Asset type
- Status
- Assigned user
- Condition
- Compliance status
- Data classification
- Encryption enabled
- Antivirus installed
- Warranty expiry
- And more

## Best Practices

- **Use consistent tagging** - Establish a naming convention for asset tags
- **Keep information current** - Update assignments and locations when assets move
- **Track security status** - Monitor encryption and antivirus status
- **Schedule audits** - Use audit dates to plan regular inventory checks
- **Monitor warranties** - Track warranty expiration to plan replacements
- **Link to implementations** - Connect assets to the controls that protect them
- **Classify data appropriately** - Tag assets with correct data classification levels
- **Document disposal** - Record disposal method and date for compliance
