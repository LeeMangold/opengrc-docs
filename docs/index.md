# Welcome to OpenGRC

OpenGRC is a cyber Governance, Risk, and Compliance web application intended for use by small-midsized businesses and teams. OpenGRC provides a resource for those who need to manage a security program but choose not to manage the price tag and complexity of alternatives.

* Simple interface designed to get up and running with very little training
* Quick imports of common security frameworks
* Ability to connect Standards, Controls, and your actual Implementations
* Ability to perform audits for internal and external assessments
* Report generation capability to create deliverables for auditors
* Vendor Management and Surveying
* Customer Trust Poral

Above all, OpenGRC is written to solve cyber compliance headaches that tend to be caused by complex enterprise solutions. It doesn't have to be that hard! While the featurset of OpenGRC is robust enough for most companies, it was designed and written by security GRC and operations experts to solve problems, not make them.
