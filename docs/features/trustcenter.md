# Trust Center

The Trust Center is a public-facing document sharing portal that allows organizations to securely share compliance, security, and certification documents with external stakeholders. It provides controlled access with approval workflows, document classification, and expiration management.

## Overview

The Trust Center enables third parties (customers, auditors, partners) to access sensitive security and compliance documents through a request-approval workflow while maintaining full control and audit trails.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Public and protected document hosting
- Access request approval workflow
- NDA agreement enforcement
- Magic link access with expiration
- Customizable branding and content
- Email notifications for requests and approvals
- Document organization by certification

## Document Types

### Public Documents
Documents marked as **Public** are available to anyone who visits your Trust Center without authentication or approval. Use this for documents you want broadly accessible.

### Protected Documents
Documents marked as **Protected** require an access request and approval before viewing. When a visitor requests access:
1. They provide their name, email, company, and reason for access
2. They agree to your NDA (if enabled)
3. An administrator reviews and approves or rejects the request
4. Approved requests receive a magic link via email

## Email Templates

Customize all Trust Center emails in **Settings** > **Trust Center Settings** > **Email Templates** tab:

### Access Request Notification
Sent to administrators when a new request is received.
- Available variables: `{{ $requesterName }}`, `{{ $requesterEmail }}`, `{{ $requesterCompany }}`, `{{ $reason }}`, `{{ $ndaAgreed }}`, `{{ $approvalUrl }}`, `{{ $documentCount }}`

### Access Approved Email

## Magic Link Access

Approved requesters receive a secure magic link that:

## Permissions

Two permission levels control Trust Center access:

| Permission | Capabilities |
|------------|--------------|
| **Manage Trust Center** | Full access: documents, settings, content blocks, certifications |
| **Manage Trust Access** | Review and approve/reject access requests only |

## Dashboard Statistics

The Trust Center Manager displays key metrics:
- **Total Documents** - Count with public/protected breakdown
- **Active Certifications** - Including custom certifications
- **Pending Requests** - Highlighted if requests are waiting
- **Content Blocks** - Enabled vs total count

## Public Trust Center URL

Your public Trust Center is accessible at:
```
https://your-domain.com/trust/
```

Share this URL with customers, auditors, and partners who need access to your security documentation.

## Best Practices

- **Organize by certification** - Group documents under relevant certifications for easy navigation
- **Set validity periods** - Use expiration dates on documents that need regular updates (SOC 2 reports, penetration tests)
- **Review requests promptly** - Pending requests create friction for customers and auditors
- **Keep NDA current** - Update your NDA text as legal requirements change
- **Use descriptive names** - Help visitors understand what each document contains
- **Monitor access** - Track which documents are being accessed and by whom
